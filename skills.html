                    <p>Heuristic is a checklist which you need to go through step by step if your Javascript code is not
                        working.
                        This checklist is important as it saves a lot of time. Every developer should be familiar with
                        it
                        and whenever an error occurs they should start with this checklist and then move on to the
                        debugging
                        part.

                        debug
                        the code. It allows direct execution of code on the website thus saving a lot of time. It is
                        important
                        for developers to know how to use the developers tools otherwise it would be difficult to create
                        fully functional web pages for and it will take a lot of time.

                    <p>Tracking errors is a crucial part of a developer's job. The errors are not only found in the code
                        itself
                        but it there could be external errors like compatibility issue. If you don't identify the error
                        you
                        won't be able to fix it. A developer should know debugging tools and the skills to track errors.
