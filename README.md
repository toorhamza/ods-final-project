This website was the final project for the Orientation to Digital Services course where we learned HTML and CSS.

We weren't allowed to use Javascript and any frameworks or libraries available for HTML or CSS.

The website was written from scratch and nothing was copied from anywhere. 

The CSS file was divided into sections with comments to make it easier to manage it. 

It is a completely responsive website which uses gridbox and flexbox layouts.
